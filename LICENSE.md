## 11. Restrictions on Commercialization of Derived Scientific Discoveries

Any scientific discovery, data, or findings obtained as a direct or indirect result of using, modifying, or interacting with the Licensed Work (including its Modified Versions) are subject to the Non-Commercial Use restrictions if they:
