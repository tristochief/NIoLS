### Emergency Procedures

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Activate emergency stop
2. Verify laser is off
3. Power down system if needed
4. Assess situation

**If Eye Exposure Occurs:**
1. Move away from beam immediately
2. Seek medical attention if vision problems occur
3. Report incident to supervisor
4. Document incident

**If Equipment Malfunctions:**
1. Shut down immediately
2. Do not attempt repair while powered
3. Isolate equipment
4. Report to qualified technician

## Prohibited Activities

### Never Do These:
