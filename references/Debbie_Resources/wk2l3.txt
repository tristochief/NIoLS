Welcome to the Galactic Akashic Readings Course! In this lesson, we will explore the concept of grounding and protection. Grounding and protection are two important concepts in the practice of Akashic readings. Grounding helps us to stay connected to the Earth and our physical body, while protection helps us to stay safe and secure from any negative energies. By the end of this lesson, you will have a better understanding of how to use grounding and protection in your Akashic readings.

Grounding is the practice of connecting to the Earth and our physical body. It helps us to stay present and focused on the task at hand. To ground, you can take a few deep breaths, imagine roots growing from your feet into the ground, or visualize a white light surrounding you. Protection is the practice of shielding yourself from any negative energies. To protect yourself, you can visualize a bubble of white light surrounding you, or imagine yourself surrounded by a protective force field. You can also use crystals, such as black tourmaline, to help protect yourself.

Grounding and protection are two important concepts in the practice of Akashic readings. By grounding and protecting yourself, you can stay safe and secure while doing your readings. With practice and dedication, you can use these techniques to help you stay connected to the Earth and your physical body while doing your readings.
