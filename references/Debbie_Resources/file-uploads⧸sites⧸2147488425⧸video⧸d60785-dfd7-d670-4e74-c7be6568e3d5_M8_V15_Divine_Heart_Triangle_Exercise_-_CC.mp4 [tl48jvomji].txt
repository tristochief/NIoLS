This is the divine heart triangle exercise.
This is the exercise you'll want to use when connecting your heart energy with your clients
before doing a reading. So imagine your heart space, your heart chakra connecting with theirs,
regardless of where they're at on the planet. From there, imagine a triangle of light connecting
your heart chakra and their heart chakra with source. So it's going to look like a light triangle.
While you're doing this, look within your third eye and look at them through your heart space
and notice any auric energy that might be in their space. What does it look like? Does it
look like sparkly energy? Does it look like colors? And that will often give you an indication
of what star systems this person might be connected with. So this is a very important
step when doing this divine heart triangle. From there, just notice it for a minute or two
and then go ahead and disconnect from them and say the records are now open.
