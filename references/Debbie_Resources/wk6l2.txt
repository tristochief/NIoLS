Week Six | May 6th, 2024
Welcome to the Galactic Akashic Readings Course! In this lesson, we will discuss how to conduct a reading. Akashic readings are a powerful tool that can help you gain insight into your life and the lives of others. They can provide guidance and clarity in times of confusion and can help you make decisions that are in alignment with your highest good. Let's get started!

Conducting a reading requires a few key steps. First, you must create a safe and sacred space for the reading. This can be done by lighting a candle, burning incense, or playing calming music. Next, you must set an intention for the reading. This can be done by writing down your intention or saying it out loud. Finally, you must open the Akashic Records. This can be done by using a guided meditation or by visualizing a door opening to the Akashic Records. Once the Records are open, you can begin the reading.

Conducting a reading is a powerful and sacred experience. It is important to remember to be respectful and mindful of the energy that you are working with. With practice and dedication, you will be able to access the Akashic Records and gain insight into your life and the lives of others. Thank you for joining me in this lesson!
