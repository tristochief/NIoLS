Welcome to the Galactic Akashic Readings Course! In this lesson, we will be discussing the important steps to take in order to prepare for a reading. We will cover the basics of what to expect, how to prepare, and the best practices for getting the most out of your reading. Let's get started!

Before a reading, it is important to take some time to meditate and clear your mind. This will help you to be more open and receptive to the messages that come through during the reading. It is also important to have an intention in mind before the reading begins. This will help to focus the reading and ensure that you get the most out of it. Lastly, it is important to be open to the messages that come through, even if they don't make sense to you in the moment. Trust that the messages are for your highest good.

Preparing for a reading is an important step in getting the most out of the experience. By taking the time to meditate, set an intention, and be open to the messages that come through, you can ensure that you get the most out of your reading. Thank you for joining me in this lesson, and I wish you the best of luck in your readings!
