Connecting with Your Guides | (Quick Read - No Video)
Week Two | April 8th, 2024
Welcome to the Galactic Akashic Readings Course! In this lesson, we will be exploring the concept of connecting with your guides. This is an important part of the Akashic Records, as it allows us to access the wisdom of the Universe. By connecting with our guides, we can gain insight into our lives and make decisions that are in alignment with our highest good.

The first step in connecting with our guides is to open our minds and hearts to the possibility of their existence. We must be willing to accept that there is more to the Universe than what we can see. Once we have opened ourselves up to this possibility, we can begin to connect with our guides. This can be done through meditation, visualization, and prayer. We can also use tools such as tarot cards, crystals, and runes to help us connect.

By connecting with our guides, we can gain insight into our lives and make decisions that are in alignment with our highest good. This is an important part of the Akashic Records and can be a powerful tool for personal growth and transformation. Thank you for joining us in this lesson and we hope you have enjoyed learning about connecting with your guides.
