# Laser Transmitter Safety Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines safety protocols for operating the Class 1M laser transmitter system. While Class 1M lasers are considered safe under normal conditions, proper safety procedures must be followed to prevent accidents and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Laser Classification

### Class 1M Laser Characteristics
- **Power Output:** ≤1 mW (visible) or ≤0.4 mW (invisible)
- **Wavelength:** 400-700 nm (visible) for Class 1M
- **Hazard Level:** Safe under normal conditions
- **Special Risk:** May be hazardous if viewed with magnifying optical instruments
- **Regulatory Status:** No special licensing required in Australia for general use

### Australian Regulations
- **ARPANSA Standards:** AS/NZS IEC 60825.1 compliance
- **Aviation Safety:** Pointing lasers at aircraft is illegal (up to 2 years imprisonment, $52,500 fine)
- **Public Safety:** Must not cause harm to persons or property
- **Labeling:** Must be properly labeled as Class 1M laser product

## Pre-Operation Safety Checklist

   - [ ] Verify automatic shutdown works
   - [ ] Check status indicators

4. **Environment:**
   - [ ] Ensure beam path is clear
   - [ ] Verify no reflective surfaces in beam path
   - [ ] Check for people or animals in area
   - [ ] Confirm no aircraft in vicinity

5. **Personal Protection:**
   - [ ] Wear appropriate eye protection (recommended)
   - [ ] Ensure proper training completed
   - [ ] Have emergency procedures ready

## Operational Safety Procedures

### Standard Operation

1. **Startup Sequence:**

   - Enable laser only when ready

2. **During Operation:**
   - Monitor laser status continuously
   - Never leave laser unattended
   - Keep beam path clear
   - Avoid direct eye exposure
   - Do not use optical instruments to view beam

3. **Shutdown Sequence:**
   - Disable laser output
   - Verify laser is off
   - Power down system
   - Secure equipment

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Immediate Shutdown:**
   - Activate safety interlock (emergency stop)
   - Power off system
   - Verify laser is off

2. **Eye Exposure:**
   - If direct eye exposure occurs, move away from beam immediately
   - Seek medical attention if any vision problems occur
   - Report incident to supervisor

3. **Equipment Malfunction:**
   - Shut down immediately
   - Do not attempt repair while powered
   - Isolate equipment
   - Report to qualified technician

## Prohibited Activities

### Never Do These:

1. **Point laser at:**
   - People or animals
   - Aircraft or vehicles
   - Reflective surfaces that could redirect beam
   - Windows or glass surfaces

2. **Operate laser:**
   - Without safety interlock
   - In presence of unauthorized persons
   - While impaired (alcohol, drugs, fatigue)
   - Without proper training

3. **Modify laser:**
   - Increase power output
   - Remove safety features
   - Bypass safety interlock
   - Alter beam characteristics

## Safety Interlock System

### Interlock Requirements

1. **Hardware Interlock:**
   - Physical switch that must be engaged for operation
   - Automatic shutdown if interlock opens
   - Status indicator (LED) shows interlock state
   - Response time: <10 ms

2. **Software Interlock:**
   - Continuous monitoring of interlock status
   - Automatic shutdown on interlock failure
   - Logging of interlock events
   - User notification of interlock status

### Interlock Testing

1. **Daily Test:**
   - Activate interlock, verify laser enables
   - Deactivate interlock, verify laser disables immediately
   - Check status indicator matches state

2. **Weekly Test:**
   - Test emergency stop function
   - Verify response time
   - Check logging functionality

## Personal Protective Equipment

### Recommended Equipment

1. **Eye Protection:**
   - Laser safety goggles (OD 2+ for 650 nm)
   - Proper wavelength rating
   - Good condition, no scratches

2. **Other Equipment:**
