## 4. Enhanced Questions for ET Stakeholders

### **For ET Engineering Specialist - Ultra-Low-Cost Laser Solutions**

1. **"You said you can detect lasers in any weather conditions and need 1-13 nanometer range. Can you detect very weak signals? We have a $2,000 budget - what's the absolute minimum power laser we could build that you could still detect?"**

2. **"You mentioned recognizing geometric patterns that symbolize your language. Can we use a simple laser pointer (under $50) with a rotating mirror to create these patterns? Would this work for your detection systems?"**

3. **"What about using a laser diode from a DVD player or laser pointer and modifying it? These cost under $20. Could we modify one to reach your 1-13 nanometer range?"**

4. **"You said you can detect lasers in any weather. Can you detect a laser that's reflected off a mirror or surface? We could use a legal laser pointer and bounce it off mirrors to create the signal you need."**

5. **"What's the smallest, cheapest laser you could detect? We're looking at building something for under $100 total. What are your minimum requirements?"**

### **For ET Pilot - Zero-Cost Communication Methods**

6. **"You mentioned coordinating with the mothership. What methods do you use that don't require any Earth technology? Can we establish this communication without any equipment?"**

7. **"When monitoring avionic systems, what information do you need from us? Can we provide this through meditation, visualization, or other free methods?"**

8. **"What backup communication methods do you have with the mothership that cost nothing? How can we support these methods?"**

9. **"Can you teach us specific meditation or consciousness techniques that would help us communicate directly with you and the mothership? This would cost nothing."**

### **For ET Medical Specialist - Budget Medical Solutions**

10. **"You mentioned needing technology for enzyme attrition, ATP composition, and cell regulation. Can these be supported using Earth's existing energy healing methods that cost nothing?"**

11. **"What specific energy frequencies or consciousness techniques can we use to support your biological maintenance needs? Can human healers or energy workers assist with this for free?"**

12. **"Are there Earth-based crystals, sound frequencies, or other natural methods that could support your biological requirements? We could source these for under $100."**

13. **"Can you provide us with specific meditation or energy work protocols that would help maintain your biological systems? This would cost nothing."**
